there is another way to do that, by using a list.
for example: lst = ['zero','one']
it's just a collection of elements. then
<lst[0]> contains the first element which is 'zero',
and <lst[1]> contains the second element: 'one'.
I'm counting on you. try to figure out how to solve
the previous problem without using "if".
